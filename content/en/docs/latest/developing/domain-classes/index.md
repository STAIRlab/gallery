These are the classes that are used to describe the finite element model
and to store the results of an analysis on this model. The classes
provide include `Domain`, `Element`, `Node`, `Load`, `Constraint` and their
subclasses. Typically, a Domain object is used as a container object to
store and provide access to the `Node`, `Element`, `Load` and `Constraint`
objects created by the `ModelBuilder` object.
