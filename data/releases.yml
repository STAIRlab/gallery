    This release includes support for markdown links and markdown images. Hinode will invoke the relevant partials, so
    they will have the same behavior and styling as their counterparts. This release also includes support for
    server-side math rendering as introduced by [Hugo v0.132.0](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.132.0).

    Hinode includes search support out of the box. To limit the bundle size, the search index now includes entries for
    the current translation only. To enable localization, the module configuration includes a new parameter `localize`.
    By default, the FlexSearch module sets localization to true.

  url: v0.1
  content:
    Inspired by Blist and Doks, this release introduces Hinode - a modern blog and documentation theme for Hugo. By
    taking advantage of npm, the used dependencies are easily tracked and updated. Powered by Bootstrap, the generated
    website is responsive and brings many common UI elements. Hinode wraps many of these elements in a shortcode to
    simplify their usage.
